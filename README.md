# NotGalaga
This project was the final project for my high school computer science class that my friend and I partnered to write. It is a Java applet that runs with a GUI and plays as a game similar to Galaga. I do not in any way own the rights to the images or the name Galaga, so don't sue me? 
Also, please note, this was written in high school, so some of our variable and object naming conventions are very bad.
