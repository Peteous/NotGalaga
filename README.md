# NotGalaga
This project was the final project for my high school computer science class that my friend and I partnered to write. It is a Java applet that runs with a GUI and plays as a game similar to Galaga. I do not in any way own the rights to the images or the name Galaga, so don't sue me? 
Also, please note, this was written in high school, so some of our variable and object naming conventions are very bad. 

##Main method file
- The main method is available in file: Lazer_Rocket_Fun.java
- Other .java files are classes and GUI material for the main method
- Image files are assets used in the GUI

##Packaged file
- Lazer_Rocket_Fun (3).zip contains a package of all code and assets used in the execution of this project when it was last compiled for school. The file was written and compiled in NetBeans IDE, so it uses the structure available in that IDE. Particularly for import statements, you will need to adjust the code such that your IDE or compiler can access everything.
